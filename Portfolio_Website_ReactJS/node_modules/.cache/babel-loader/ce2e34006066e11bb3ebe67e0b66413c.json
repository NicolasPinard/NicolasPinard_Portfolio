On my first day, a consultant was about to spend days reformatting tens of thousands of records in a CSV file. My mentor suggested that would be a good first project, so in a few hours I automatically processed all the rows and saved days if not a whole week of tedious manual work to that person which gave me the confidence boost I needed. All in all, it was a very good environment for a first internship and I am very grateful for it. My main project was generating charts using Java, Javascript and SQL.

However, at the time, I felt a bit lost in what direction I wanted to take with my career, so I went with the safer picked the safe pick of going on with my education. I could have gotten an additional 3 years of practical experience by the end of my bachelor, but if I would have started in a company with bad practices, it would have been harder to change. At the start of university, I was extremely motivated. Mostly everyone seemed to have done internship as well, so everybody was very hands-on and it was challenging. After a hard semester of adjustment to the likes of calculus, I did my second internship at Ericsson. This was my first experience in a fully agile team which allowed me to greatly improved my soft skills. Our team was composed of a product owner, a senior developer and six interns. While you probably imagine this was pure chaos, it actually worked out pretty well! We were not the type of interns causing chaos left and right, we were the type of getting sh#t done! The previous interns started a test automation framework, however it needed some love and more features. During that internship, I learned to code in Python, Bash and use Jenkins. More importantly, I underestimated tasks, tried to solve problems on my own for too long and created false expectations in stakeholders of other teams. This is more important, because I learned much more from that than from the good, but I swear I created a lot more value than harm!\")), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(TimelineItem, {\n      key: \"005\",\n      dateText: \"Winter 2017\",\n      style: {\n        color: '#e86971'\n      },\n      bodyContainerStyle: {\n        background: '#ddd',\n        padding: '20px',\n        borderRadius: '8px',\n        boxShadow: '0.5rem 0.5rem 2rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)'\n      },\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 102,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"h4\", {\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 111,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    }, \"Getting out of my comfort zone\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 112,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    }, \"So far everything was going smoothly, classes seemed much easier than at the start and I didn't have any issues finding internships during the summer.

I ended up doing an exchange at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and could only get 3 class accreditated.

From there, I knew this was my career path, but I wasn't sure what to specialize in. So, over the course of the following years I did a bit of everything including web development, test automation and embedded development. At that point, I felt a bit lost because none of those specialization met what I had in mind. I decided to explore one last area before calling it quits and that is when I joined TickSmith mostly working with Big Data tools and AWS. I feel empowered knowing that the code that I right is responsible to ingest, process and distribute terrabytes of data. Coupling between components must be reduced at a maximum for each component to be ready to be scaled up exponentially. I love that the most speciliazed and performant frameworks used in our tech stack such as Spark, Hive and Impala are all open-sourced. However, when leveraging open source frameworks there is often a lot of manual setup required to do on our own. I worked with some great DevOps specialists that introduced and empowered me to use and understand the moving pieces in our infrastructure such as AWS, Terraform and Ansible. From there, I tried to be more autonomous and rely less on the DevOps. I seized the great opportunity offered by my company to pass the AWS Associate Developer certification and it allowed me to see the services I was often using from a different perspective so that I would truly understand them. This last year was worth like 3 years of experience for me, I feel much more confident now and ready to take on any challenges that come up!\"));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default About;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/nicolas/Projects/React/NicolasPinard_Portfolio/Portfolio_Website_ReactJS/src/contents/About.js"],"names":["React","Component","Timeline","TimelineItem","About","render","color","background","padding","borderRadius","boxShadow"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,SAASC,QAAT,EAAmBC,YAAnB,QAAwC,uCAAxC;;AAGA,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBH,SAApB,CAA8B;AAC1BI,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACL,wBACI;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBACI;AAAI,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,UAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,4BAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,8CAHJ,eAII;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAJJ,eAKI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oIALJ,eAOI,oBAAC,QAAD;AAAU,MAAA,SAAS,EAAE,MAArB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBACI,oBAAC,YAAD;AACA,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,KADJ;AAEA,MAAA,QAAQ,EAAC,MAFT;AAGA,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEC,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAHP;AAIA,MAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE;AACpBC,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,MADQ;AAEpBC,QAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAFW;AAGpBC,QAAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAHM;AAIpBC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AAJS,OAJpB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAUI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,mDAVJ,eAWI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oZAXJ,CADJ,eAkBI,oBAAC,YAAD;AACA,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,KADJ;AAEA,MAAA,QAAQ,EAAC,kBAFT;AAGA,MAAA,cAAc,EAAE;AAAEH,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,SAAd;AAAyBD,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAhC,OAHhB;AAIA,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEA,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAJP;AAKA,MAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE;AACpBC,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,MADQ;AAEpBC,QAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAFW;AAGpBC,QAAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAHM;AAIpBC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AAJS,OALpB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAUI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,+CAVJ,eAWI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qsBAXJ,CAlBJ,eAqCI,oBAAC,YAAD;AACA,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,KADJ;AAEA,MAAA,QAAQ,EAAC,MAFT;AAGA,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEJ,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAHP;AAIA,MAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE;AACpBC,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,MADQ;AAEpBC,QAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAFW;AAGpBC,QAAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAHM;AAIpBC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AAJS,OAJpB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBASI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wCATJ,eAUI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,skCAVJ,CArCJ,eA2DI,oBAAC,YAAD;AACA,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,KADJ;AAEA,MAAA,QAAQ,EAAC,kBAFT;AAGA,MAAA,cAAc,EAAE;AAAEH,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,SAAd;AAAyBD,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAhC,OAHhB;AAIA,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEA,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAJP;AAKA,MAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE;AACpBC,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,MADQ;AAEpBC,QAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAFW;AAGpBC,QAAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAHM;AAIpBC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AAJS,OALpB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,mCAVA,eAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,orDAXA,CA3DJ,eAuFI,oBAAC,YAAD;AACA,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,KADJ;AAEA,MAAA,QAAQ,EAAC,aAFT;AAGA,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEJ,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAHP;AAIA,MAAA,kBAAkB,EAAE;AACpBC,QAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,MADQ;AAEpBC,QAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,MAFW;AAGpBC,QAAAA,YAAY,EAAE,KAHM;AAIpBC,QAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AAJS,OAJpB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wCATA,eAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,guBAVA,CAvFJ,eAyGI,oBAAC,YAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAzGJ,CAPJ,eAoHI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wpDApHJ,CADJ;AA0IC;;AA5IqB;;AA+I9B,eAAeN,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Timeline, TimelineItem }  from 'vertical-timeline-component-for-react';\n\n\nclass About extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"condiv\">\n                <h1 className=\"subtopic\">About Me</h1>\n                <h2>I'm Nicolas Pinard</h2>\n                <h3>Full Stack Developer | Data Engineer</h3>\n                <br/>\n                <h3>Below is a timeline of various events and key moments of my career from the time I learned programming all the way to now!</h3>\n\n                <Timeline lineColor={'#ddd'}>\n                    <TimelineItem \n                    key=\"001\" \n                    dateText=\"2011\" \n                    style={{ color: '#e86971' }}\n                    bodyContainerStyle={{\n                    background: '#ddd',\n                    padding: '20px',\n                    borderRadius: '8px',\n                    boxShadow: '0.5rem 0.5rem 2rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)'\n                    }}>\n                        <h4>First steps into the world of programming</h4>\n                        <p>I started coding in 2011, I didn't know what Java was other than that thing that you always \n                        need to update on your computer.

However, after those first two introduction classes to Java, I \n                        was feeling more at ease and learned faster the various topics such as JavaScript, PHP and Databases.</p>\n                    </TimelineItem>\n                    <TimelineItem\n                    key=\"003\"\n                    dateText=\"2014\"\n                    style={{ color: '#e86971' }}\n                    bodyContainerStyle={{\n                    background: '#ddd',\n                    padding: '20px',\n                    borderRadius: '8px',\n                    boxShadow: '0.5rem 0.5rem 2rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)'}}>\n                        <h4>My first real world experience</h4>\n                        <p>At the end of my program I did an internship at Bombardier Aerospace which wasn't doing so bad at the \n                        time and it was a nice introduction to the work environment. I was 19 at the time and all of my \n                        colleagues were at least 30 with the majority of them being over 40. On my first day, a consultant was \n                        about to spend days reformatting tens of thousands of records in a CSV file. My mentor suggested that \n                        would be a good first project, so in a few hours I automatically processed all the rows and saved days \n                        if not a whole week of tedious manual work to that person which gave me the confidence boost I needed. \n                        All in all, it was a very good environment for a first internship and I am very grateful for it. My main \n                        project was generating charts using Java, Javascript and SQL. Before I came, the charts needed to be \n                        generated manually in Excel or Access which was a tedious process, but with some mentoring, I was able \n                        to create a service from scratch that dynamically generates charts. It felt very rewarding to finally \n                        produce something tangible that will be used after the due date!</p>\n                    </TimelineItem>\n                    <TimelineItem \n                    key=\"004\" \n                    dateText=\"2014 – 2015\" \n                    dateInnerStyle={{ background: '#61b8ff', color: '#000' }}\n                    style={{ color: \"#61b8ff\"}}\n                    bodyContainerStyle={{\n                    background: '#ddd',\n                    padding: '20px',\n                    borderRadius: '8px',\n                    boxShadow: '0.5rem 0.5rem 2rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)'}}>\n                    <h4>The first crossroad faced</h4>\n                    <p>Following my internship, I had officially graduated from a Computer Science program. I had two choices ahead: \n                    continue with my education and get a Bachelor in Software Engineering or become one of those self-taught engineers \n                    who learned on the job. However, at the time, I felt a bit lost in what direction I wanted to take with my\n                    career, so I went with the safer picked the safe pick of going on with my education. I could have gotten an \n                    additional 3 years of practical experience by the end of my bachelor, but if I would have started in a company \n                    with bad practices, it would have been harder to change. At the start of university, I was extremely motivated. \n                    Mostly everyone seemed to have done internship as well, so everybody was very hands-on and it was challenging. After \n                    a hard semester of adjustment to the likes of calculus, I did my second internship at Ericsson. This was my first \n                    experience in a fully agile team which allowed me to greatly improved my soft skills. Our team was composed of a \n                    product owner, a senior developer and six interns. While you probably imagine this was pure chaos, it actually \n                    worked out pretty well! We were not the type of interns causing chaos left and right, we were the type of getting \n                    sh#t done! The previous interns started a test automation framework, however it needed some love and more features.\n                    During that internship, I learned to code in Python, Bash and use Jenkins. More importantly, I underestimated tasks,\n                    tried to solve problems on my own for too long and created false expectations in stakeholders of other teams. This \n                    is more important, because I learned much more from that than from the good, but I swear I created a lot more value \n                    than harm!</p>\n                    </TimelineItem>\n                    <TimelineItem\n                    key=\"005\"\n                    dateText=\"Winter 2017\"\n                    style={{ color: '#e86971' }}\n                    bodyContainerStyle={{\n                    background: '#ddd',\n                    padding: '20px',\n                    borderRadius: '8px',\n                    boxShadow: '0.5rem 0.5rem 2rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)'}}>\n                    <h4>Getting out of my comfort zone</h4>\n                    <p>So far everything was going smoothly, classes seemed much easier than at the start and I didn't have any issues\n                    finding internships during the summer. I always wanted to do a session abroad, but unfortunately my school tightened\n                    what course could be accepted to get credit for an engineering class. So, that closed up a lot of universities that \n                    had Computer Science program but not Software Engineering. I ended up doing an exchange at the University of British \n                    Columbia in Vancouver and could only get 3 class accreditated. I thought I was going to have an easy time and have \n                    plenty of time to visit the places around. But unfortunately (or fortunately), those 3 classes were the hardest that \n                    I have ever taken. Two of them, </p>\n                    </TimelineItem>\n                    <TimelineItem>\n                        \n                    </TimelineItem>\n                </Timeline>\n                <p>With time, I started to being more at ease solving the various \n                challenges of programming and started to actually like it! From there, I knew this was my career path, \n                but I wasn't sure what to specialize in. So, over the course of the following years I did a bit of \n                everything including web development, test automation and embedded development. At that point, I felt a\n                bit lost because none of those specialization met what I had in mind. I decided to explore one last area \n                before calling it quits and that is when I joined TickSmith mostly working with Big Data tools and AWS.\n                I feel empowered knowing that the code that I right is responsible to ingest, process and distribute \n                terrabytes of data. Coupling between components must be reduced at a maximum for each component to be \n                ready to be scaled up exponentially. I love that the most speciliazed and performant frameworks used in \n                our tech stack such as Spark, Hive and Impala are all open-sourced. However, when leveraging open source \n                frameworks there is often a lot of manual setup required to do on our own. I worked with some great DevOps\n                specialists that introduced and empowered me to use and understand the moving pieces in our infrastructure \n                such as AWS, Terraform and Ansible. From there, I tried to be more autonomous and rely less on the DevOps. \n                I seized the great opportunity offered by my company to pass the AWS Associate Developer certification and \n                it allowed me to see the services I was often using from a different perspective so that I would truly \n                understand them. This last year was worth like 3 years of experience for me, I feel much more confident \n                now and ready to take on any challenges that come up!\n                </p>\n            \n            </div>\n            )\n        }\n    }\n    \nexport default About\n    "]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
